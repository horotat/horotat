### Hi there 👋
I am a [PhD student](https://kth.se/profile/alimk) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Early stage researcher in [Early Language Development in the Digital Age (e-LADDA) MSCA ITN](https://e-ladda.eu). I stand on the meet point of Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Social Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence, where I always loved to be. Check out more on my personal website: [Ali.MK](http://ali.mk/)

I advocate for open-source and belive in sharing. My main programming languages are 🐍`Python`, `Kotlin`, and `R`. I am able to scramble websites as well. I am not a developer by definition, but surley I can and do develop the systems that I need as tools for my 👨‍🔬 research projects, 🔬 experiments, and as 🤹🏻‍♂️ a personal hubby.

I have graduated from M.Sc. in Cognitive Science at [Center for Mind/Brain Studies (CIMeC)](https://cimec.unitn.it), [University of Trento](https://unitn.it). I visited [Tilburg University](https://tilburguniversity.edu) for an Internship and partially my master thesis project during 2019-2020.
