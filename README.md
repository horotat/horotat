### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a master student of Cognitive Science at [Center for Mind/Brain Studies (CIMeC)](https://cimec.unitn.it), [University of Trento](https://unitn.it). Currently I am busy writing my thesis under supervision of [Aurelie Herbelot](https://aurelieherbelot.net/) and [Afra Alishahi](http://afra.alishahi.name/). My focus in my project is on Adjectives in Computational Models of Lexical Acquisition. I was visiting [Tilburg University](https://tilburguniversity.edu) for an Internship and partially my thesis project.
