### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a master student of Cognitive Science at [Center for Mind/Brain Studies (CIMeC)](https://cimec.unitn.it){:target="\_blank"}, [University of Trento](https://unitn.it){:target="\_blank"}. Currently I am busy writing my thesis under supervision of [Aurelie Herbelot](https://aurelieherbelot.net/){:target="\_blank"} and [Afra Alishahi](http://afra.alishahi.name/){:target="\_blank"}. My focus in my project is on Adjectives in Computational Models of Lexical Acquisition. I was visiting [Tilburg University](https://tilburguniversity.edu){:target="\_blank"} for an Internship and partially my thesis project.

I will be starting my PhD in Linguistics at [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://ntnu.edu){:target="\_blank"} and the Associate Researcher position at [Furhat Robotics](https://furhatrobotics.com){:target="\_blank"} in Stockholm, Sweden. My project is part of [MSCA ITN Early Language Development in the Digital Age (e-LADDA)](https://www.ntnu.edu/e-ladda){:target="\_blank"} project. I stand on the meet point of Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Social Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence, where I always loved to be.
