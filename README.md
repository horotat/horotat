### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a PhD student of [MSCA ITN Early Language Development in the Digital Age (e-LADDA)](https://www.ntnu.edu/e-ladda) project. I stand on the meet point of Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Social Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence, where I always loved to be. Check out more on [Kamelabad.EU](http://kamelabad.eu/)

I have graduated from M.Sc. in Cognitive Science at [Center for Mind/Brain Studies (CIMeC)](https://cimec.unitn.it), [University of Trento](https://unitn.it). I visited [Tilburg University](https://tilburguniversity.edu) for an Internship and partially my master thesis project during 2019-2020.
